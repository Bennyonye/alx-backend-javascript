# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on mastering ES6 data manipulation techniques in JavaScript. You will learn how to use various array methods and data structures effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly:

- Using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays.
- Understanding typed arrays.
- Utilizing Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures.
