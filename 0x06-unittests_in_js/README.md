# 0x06. Unittests in JS

This project focuses on learning how to write and implement unit tests in JavaScript using tools like Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. You'll explore various testing techniques, including writing unit tests for asynchronous functions, integration tests for Node.js servers, and using spies, stubs, and hooks.

## Resources
To get started and gain a deeper understanding, refer to these resources:
- [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
- [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Use **Mocha** to write a test suite.
- Use different assertion libraries like **Node** or **Chai**.
- Structure and present long test suites.
- Understand and apply:
  - **Spies**: When and how to use them.
  - **Stubs**: When and how to use them.
  - **Hooks**: What they are and when to use them.
- Write unit tests for **asynchronous functions**.
- Write **integration tests** for small Node.js servers.

---

## Requirements
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 18.04 using Node 12.x.x
- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, Visual Studio Code
- Code files must use the `.js` extension.
- All files should end with a new line.
- All tests must run correctly using:
  ```bash
  npm run test *.test.js
  ```
- No warnings or errors should be displayed during test execution.
- A README.md file is mandatory in the project folder.

---

## Project Tasks
### 1. **Setting Up Mocha**
- Install Mocha globally:
  ```bash
  npm install --global mocha
  ```
- Create a test directory and ensure Mocha can detect your test files.

### 2. **Writing Tests with Chai**
- Use Chai for assertions:
  ```javascript
  const { expect } = require('chai');
  expect(value).to.equal(expectedValue);
  ```

### 3. **Using Sinon for Spies and Stubs**
- Understand how to track function calls and simulate behaviors using Sinon:
  ```javascript
  const sinon = require('sinon');
  const spy = sinon.spy(object, 'method');
  ```

### 4. **Testing Async Functions**
- Write tests for asynchronous operations using `async/await` or callbacks.

### 5. **Integration Testing**
- Use tools like **supertest** to test Express.js routes:
  ```javascript
  const request = require('supertest');
  const app = require('./app');
  request(app).get('/route').expect(200);
  ```

---

## Example Test Script
Here's an example of a simple test file:
```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai');
const sinon = require('sinon');
const myFunction = require('./myModule');

describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  it('should return true when input is valid', () => {
    const result = myFunction('valid input');
    expect(result).to.be.true;
  });
});
```

---

## Running the Tests
Run all test files with the following command:
```bash
npm run test *.test.js
```

Ensure all tests pass with no warnings or errors.
